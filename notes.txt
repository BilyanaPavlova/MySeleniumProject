RUN ALLURE REPORTS IN BROWSER COMMANDS:

Ô∏è‚É£ Add the Allure Maven Plugin**

Add this inside your `<build><plugins>` section:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>io.qameta.allure</groupId>
    <artifactId>allure-maven</artifactId>
    <version>2.13.10</version> <!-- latest stable -->
    <configuration>
        <resultsDirectory>${project.build.directory}/allure-results</resultsDirectory>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

---

 Run tests and generate report**

```bash
# Run your tests (TestNG + Maven)
mvn clean test

# Generate Allure report
mvn allure:report

# Open the report
mvn allure:serve

* `mvn allure:report` generates the HTML files in `target/site/allure-maven/`.
* `mvn allure:serve` starts a local server and opens the report in your browser.

üí° **Tip:** Make sure your `allure-results` folder is inside `target/`
(as we configured in the Surefire plugin), otherwise the plugin won‚Äôt find the results.

*Note!!!!:
The mvn allure:serve command starts a local web server to display the Allure report
and keeps running until you manually stop it. This process stays active in the terminal
to serve the report at a local address (usually http://localhost:port).
You need to stop it with Ctrl+C when you are done viewing the report.

When running in Jenkins, there is no interactive terminal, so you cannot use Ctrl+C. Instead:


Jenkins jobs should not use mvn allure:serve because it starts a server and waits indefinitely.
Use mvn allure:report to generate the static HTML report files.
Archive the generated report (e.g., from target/site/allure-maven/) as a build artifact or use a Jenkins Allure plugin to publish the report.
This way, the process finishes automatically, and the report is accessible from Jenkins UI.
